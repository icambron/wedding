%p= "Hi #{@family.name}!"

%p Here are a few last minute wedding updates. We're sending this email to everyone we invited, so that'll include some of you who unfortunately can't make it, but we thought we'd keep you in th loop anyway.

      %strong Registry.
      %span We set up a registry page. It's a bit...unique. You can find it here:
      %a{href: authenticated_url(@family, "gifts")}= authenticated_url(@family, "/gifts")
      %span . If you've already gotten us something, or if you just plain don't like the idea, don't sweat it.
  %li
    %p
      %strong Travel and accommodations.
      %span If you're having any trouble with travel and accommodations (e.g. you're not sure how you're getting from the airport to the venue), just drop us a line. We'll fix you right up.
  %li
    %p
      %strong Are you sure you don't want meat?
      %span A lot more of you signed up for the "plant" option than we'd guessed. That's cool and it's going to be delicious (and there's plenty of it). But we're also especially excited about the barbecued pulled pork and chicken. So if you're reconsidering, just email us.

      %strong Dress code.
      %span A few of you have asked about the dress code. We don't have a dress code. Wear whatever you're comfortable in. If that's a nice suit, go for it. If it's your faded Led Zeppelin T-shirt, that's cool too. If it's last year's Halloween costume, who are we to judge? If you must know, Anjali's wearing a wedding dress and Isaac's wearing a dress shirt with no tie.
    %p But we do encourage you to wear a hat. This is a hatted wedding. They can be serious hats or silly hats. Big or small. Formal or casual. Ornate or simple. Consider our wedding a safe zone for headgear.

%p -Isaac and Anjali
