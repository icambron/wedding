      We have a block of rooms at the

        %a(href="http://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/massachusetts/doubletree-by-hilton-hotel-boston-north-shore-BOSNSDT/index.html") North Shore DoubleTree
      and 
      %strong will also be providing a shuttle from there to Willowdale. So if you stay there, you won't have to drive.

    %p If for some reason, that just isn't your bag, here are some alternatives:

    %ul
      %li
        %a(href="http://www.comfortinn.com/hotel-danvers-massachusetts-MA081?source=gglocaljn") Comfort Inn
        in Danvers
      %li
        %a(href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/BOSDV-Courtyard-Boston-Danvers") Courtyard
        in Danvers

    %p But you should really stay in the DoubleTree if you can. Here's a handy map with the hotels (red) and the venue (blue):

    %h2 Getting there

    %p The easiest thing to do is to fly into Logan Airport and drive. Directions from different places:

    %ul
      %li from Boston
      %li from NYC

    %p Once you're around you can either:

    %ul
      %li Drive to your hotel, park, and jump on one of the buses we charted to take you to and from the hotel. That's what we recommend.
      %li Just drive to the venue. There's plenty of parking.
